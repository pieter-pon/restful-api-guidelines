Software and software ecosystems are resolutions for business challenges, 
which in effect will result in a firm reliance of the business on the software 
and corresponding integrations. Moreover, our entrepreneurial mindset will 
drive updates, changes, and additions to the software; software is rarely 
"done" or "finished."

The business challenges and corresponding software updates are where these 
guidelines come in. To a certain degree, how can we guide the software 
development to ensure the software is stable, does what it should do, is 
secure, and is updateable with reasonable effort.

These guidelines and standards do not prescribe the "perfect" way to build
software and software integrations since there is no "perfect" way. However, the
consistency and structure of the code and integrations are specified.
Summarized: solve the same problem with the same solution.

This document will enable the business to make informed decisions about software
development: quantify the software's quality and robustness in an automated,
consistent manner; be aware of the quality and robustness and decide upon the
required level.

Moreover, this document contains several standards regarding intellectual 
property (IP) and security. To assure correct undisputed ownership of the 
software and maintain a security baseline.

In the following chapters, software refers both to software and software 
integrations.

== Software engineering

In the mid-1960s the field of software engineering emerged, building software
is about more than just writing instructions for a computer. In order for the
business to actually be able to use the software, the following points are
addressed in these guidelines
[link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering[Wikipedia]]:

* Software requirements
* Software architecture and design
* Software development
* Software testing
* Software maintenance

=== Software requirements

Establish the needs of the business to be resolved by software. This involves
gathering the requirements and specifying the goals of the software to be met
[link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_requirements[Wikipedia]].

Next to the business requirements this document contains the minimal standards
for software; including software license and source code management.

____
If you want to build an application, don’t herd people together to build
code and don’t assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long 
for the endless joy of happy efficient users.
____

=== Software architecture and design

Architecture and design are where the Art of Building Software comes in, the
architecture and design are the foundation of the software. This document will
provide guidance towards selecting the architecture and creating the design.
There are some specific don'ts and do's however it is up to the architect to
create the optimal design by taking all business requirements into consideration
[link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design[Wikipedia]].

=== Software development

How much effort is required for another developer of comparable experience to
pick up where the previous developer left off to fix, enhance or build upon the
source code - without involving the former developer and taking into account the
lifetime, quality, security and the business impact of the application. 

=== Software testing

The proof of the pudding is in the eating, a good cook will sample the dish
before serving the guests. The software is build upon requirements and it is up
to the software engineers to indicate the proven level of adherence to these
requirements; preferably in an automated manner. It is up to the business to
decide on the level of awareness regarding the software quality based on
testing.

=== Software maintenance and support

When the latest version of the software has been deployed there are two,
continuously ongoing, tasks. Firstly: bug fixing, updates and new features; this
requires the software to be flexible, adaptable and logically structured. Note
there is an overlap with software development: clean quality code will require a
lower effort to adjust or fix as opposed to ill-structured low-quality code.

Secondly: the level of availability and performance of the software; this
requires the software to be monitorable and able to report about its own
wellbeing. Note there is overlap with software testing, a test to check if the
software is adhering to a requirement can be reused in the live environment to
check if the software is operational and responding within a predefined
timeframe.


== Document management

This document is managed using Git. Git allows for controlled change approval,
versioning and tracking of updates and changes. Moreover it is an open system
allowing for community change suggestions.


== Attribution

These guidelines are based on the

The requirement level keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
"SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" used in this document (case insensitive) are to be
interpreted as described in https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt[RFC

.Standards
====
MUST is by default a standard and not a guideline.

[[pon-specific-information]]
== Pon specific information

These guidelines apply to all software owned by Pon, build by Pon or build for
Pon; more specifically where the IP is owned by Pon. Note this excludes SaaS
solutions.
 
The purpose of these guidelines is to define standards to successfully establish
"consistent integration and development look and feel" quality. The integration
and development guilds drafted and own this document. Teams are responsible to
fulfill these guidelines during development and are encouraged to contribute to
guideline evolution via pull requests.

These guidelines will, to some extent, remain work in progress as our work
evolves, but teams can confidently follow and trust them.

In case guidelines are changing, the following rules apply:

* existing software and software integrations don't have to be changed, but we
recommend it 
* clients of existing APIs have to cope with these APIs based on outdated rules 
* new APIs have to respect the current guidelines

Furthermore you should keep in mind that once an API becomes public externally
available, it has to be re-reviewed and changed according to current guidelines
- for the sake of overall consistency.

=== Automated code style checking (linting)

Digital Solutions will provide a preferred code style configuration per language
or application which can be retrieved from the repository of this document.

Code styles are approved and maintained by the software development guild.


[[guidelines-and-standards]]
=== Guideline or standard

If a rule is a Pon standard is indicated by an additional "S" being added to the
rule number and green left margin.
