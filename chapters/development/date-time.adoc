Date and time handling guidelines, including time intervals and durations.

[#296]
== {STATUS-RFP} {MUST} use ISO 8601 for time and date encoding

The international standard {ISO-8601}[ISO 8601] must be used for time and date
encoding unless not feasible due to technical constraints.

[#295]
== {STATUS-RFP} {MUST} date time manipulation must be handled by a library

Date and time manipulation is very complex and involves many one-offs and thus 
very error prone. Date and time manipulation must be handled by a dedicated
library, which is available for all main development languages.

[#127]
== {SHOULD} define time durations and intervals properties conform to ISO 8601

Schema based JSON properties that are by design durations and intervals could
be strings formatted as recommended by {ISO-8601}[ISO 8601]({RFC-3339}#appendix-A[Appendix A of RFC 3339 contains a grammar] for durations).
