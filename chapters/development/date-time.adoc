= Date and time handling

This chapter handles the date and the time guidelines, including time intervals
and durations.

[#296]
== {STATUS-RFP} {MUST} use RFC 3339 for time and date encoding

The international standard {RFC-3339}[RFC-3339] must be used for time and date
encoding unless not feasible due to technical constraints.

[#295]
== {STATUS-RFP} {MUST} date time manipulation must be handled by a library

Date and time manipulation is very complex and involves many one-offs, and thus
very error-prone. Date and time manipulation must be handled by a dedicated
library, which is available for all main development languages.

[#127]
== {SHOULD} define time durations and intervals properties conform to RFC 3339

Schema-based JSON properties that are by design durations and intervals could
be strings formatted as recommended by {RFC-3339}[RFC-3339] ({RFC-3339}#appendix-A[Appendix A of RFC 3339 contains a grammar] for durations).
