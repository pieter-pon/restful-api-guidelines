== Purpose

Great software and software integrations look like they were designed by a
single team. This promotes adoption, reduces friction, and enables clients to
the software and software integrations properly. To build software and software
integrations that meet this standard, and to answer many common questions
encountered along the way of development, the Pon integration guild and Pon
software development guild have created this comprehensive set of guidelines. We
have shared it with you to inspire additional discussion and refinement within
and among your teams, and contribute our learnings and suggestions to the tech
community at large.

== Usage

Feel free to use these guidelines as a guidance for your own development. Note
that we encourage our own teams to use them in order to challenge their software
and software integratons. As such, you should consider this to be a living,
evolving document. We will revise and update based on our learnings and
experiences.
